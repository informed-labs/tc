```admonish title="Functor"
A functor is an acyclic DAG or topology of events, routes, flow, functions and infrastructure components. To use Ruby as an analogy, Functor is akin to a Module, a stepfunction or flow as a Class and methods are steps or functions.
```

```admonish title="Topology"
A topology is the representation of a functor as a configuration (typically topology.yml). This represents a service in it's entireity
```

```admonish title="Components"
Components are atomic units in a topology that can be updated independently for faster dev iteration. Components themselves are also versioned but not exposed in the high-level topology
